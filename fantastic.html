										<h2><a href="#">Scenario</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As the year 2024 came to a close, five friends (Althea, Gabby, Danny, Jenny & Roger) decided to meet up with a shared goal: reviewing their finances before stepping into 2025. Each of them had unique circumstances—credit card bills—and they wanted to better understand their financial health. However, as they began looking through their statements, they felt overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of their transactions and patterns. Realizing they needed help, they reached out to a data analyst who could uncover insights from their financial data, helping them make sense of their spending habits and empowering them with actionable recommendations for the year ahead.</p>
									
									<header>
										<h3><a href="#">Objective</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Define and understand the financial trends of the individuals.</p>

									<header>
										<h3><a href="#">Key Questions</h3>
									</header>
                                     <p>What trends exist over time?</p>
									 <p>What categories have the most and least spending?</p>
									
									<hr />
									<header>
										<h2>Data Collection</h2>
										<p>To ensure the integrity of this independent project, I developed a systematic data collection process that can be understood by the participants. The framework of the data collection was quantitative data as I requested the participants last 3 credit card statements to get a better understanding of their shareholders objective and a starting guideline to the overall project. To maintain consistency and accuracy, it was important to have guidelines to input the data into the spreadsheet or first party data in data science terms. Data was organized as followed:</p>
									</header>
								<!-- Lists -->
									<h3>Guidelines</h3>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

												<li>Standardized data formats in Excel, SQL & Tableau.</li>
												<li>Seperated raw & processed Data.</li>
												<li>Consistent data dictionary.</li>
												<li>Version control.</li>
												<li>Data validation for inconsistencies.</li>
											</ol>
										</div>
									</div>

									<hr />


									<h3>Limitations</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt>External Market Influences</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Credit card usage can be influenced by the world/country's economic status, unexpected events and seasonal spending trends. In this project's case the months of the credit card statements can be referred to as "Holidays' which inaccurately reflect their spending.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Regulatory & Privacy Constraints</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Compliance with PCI-DSS, GDPR, and other financial regulations limits access to certain customer details, restricting the depth of analysis on individual behaviors and trends.</p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<hr />
									<header>
										<h2>Analyzation</h2>
										<p>Refer to the examples of performing calculations in SQL that illustrated my data analysis process. I have a wide and extensive range of data analysis knowledge. Such as performing simple aggregate functions to Common Table Expressions (CTE's), Subquery's, Window Functions & JOIN. </p>

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>After presenting the dashboards to the participants, we were able to discuss my findings 
										and coordinated a system to monitor their spending in a guideline template for 2025. 
										*Unable to disclose findings due to client confidentality*</p>
									
									
									<p>Completing this project  was another opportunity to transform raw data into actionable insights. 
									By leveraging analytical tools and methodologies, I identified key financial trends, optimized reporting 
									processes, and provided valuable recommendations to drive informed decision-making. This project is just 
									one of many in my journey, as working with data is more than just a profession—it’s my passion. Every dataset 
									presents a new challenge, and I thrive on uncovering meaningful patterns that contribute to smarter personal/
									business strategies. With each project, I continue refining my expertise and deepening my enthusiasm for 
									data-driven problem-solving. </p>
